# Rock_Paper_Scissors
This is a kids' game Rock-Paper-Scissors from childhood, only to be relived digitally in python shell

The sole purpose of coding the logic behind the game is to explore the language and to gain some experience in modular programming. This doesn't serve any purpose nor solves any impending issues only other than just pure knowledge and insight into python programming.

To run the code you can just run the following command windows / Linux command prompt:

python3 -m RockPaperScissors.py

or run the following from python shell from the folder where you have saved the code

>> import RockPaperScissors as rps
and then,
>> rps.main()
